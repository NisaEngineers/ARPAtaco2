wavs/historyofforestry_01_fernow_0001.wav|if there be one philosophy more readily derivable than another from the study of the history of Forestry it is that history repeats itself
wavs/historyofforestry_01_fernow_0003.wav|we can study the results broadening our judgement and thereby avoid the mistakes of others
wavs/historyofforestry_01_fernow_0004.wav|no where is the record of experience and the historic method of study is more value than in an empirical art like Forestry in which it takes decades a lifetime a century to see the final effects of operations
wavs/historyofforestry_01_fernow_0006.wav|Forestry is an art born of necessity as opposed to arts of convenience and of pleasure
wavs/historyofforestry_01_fernow_0008.wav|hence its beginnings a car in different places at different times and its development proceeds at different places
wavs/historyofforestry_01_fernow_0010.wav|and such differences as we shall see may even exist in the different parts of the same country

wavs/historyofforestry_01_fernow_0014.wav|again we find that more than a century ago fear of a timber famine agitated not only the dense populations of many European countries but even the scanty population of the United States in spite of the natural forest wealth which is still supplying us

wavs/historyofforestry_01_fernow_0020.wav|yes we are still largely ignorant as to the extent of available forest area not only in this country but elsewhere
wavs/historyofforestry_01_fernow_0021.wav|we do not know whether it be sufficient in exchange and yield to furnish a continuous supply for the needs of our Civilization or if not for how long a time it will suffice
wavs/historyofforestry_01_fernow_0022.wav|we can only make very broad statements as to questions of woods supply and very broad inferences from them as argument for the need of a closest study of forest conditions and of the practice of forestry
